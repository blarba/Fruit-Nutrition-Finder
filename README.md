# Fruit Nutrition Finder
This is the Fruit Nutrition Finder - a simple project that makes use of the Fruityvice API.

## Project Description
The website has several pages - the home and about pages are self-explanatory and talk a little bit about how to use the website and the functionality of the other pages.
The Fruit Finder tab lets you search for a fruit in the Fruityvice database by its name, family, genus, or order, and returns all fruits (if possible) containing the search term.
The Nutrition Sorter searches for a particular nutrient (like carbs, protein, fat, etc.) and filters search results based on a minimum and maximum value inputted by the user.
The Fruit Database simply loads all available fruits within the Fruityvice database.

## Target Browsers
This is mainly for use on a desktop, as I have not tested the usability of the website on mobile platforms.
